It has been a while, a whole year has passed living the pandemic life, however turbulent and life-changing it has been. I'm grateful for being able to read more and learn new things while "confined" to my home. Here is a book that I wanted to read for a long time. Hopefully taking notes will help me to remember the takeaways!

### Make money work for you
- Having a regular job is a short-term solution to the long-term problem of creating wealth and financial freedom

### Assets vs Liabilities
- It's not about how much money you make, but about how much money you keep. 
- Asset: something that has value, produces income or appreciates. Invest as much of your money as possible in assets. Examples are: interest paying bonds, stocks, investment real estate, intellectual products like books/art. Liabilities are e.g cars, vacations, clothes, eating out, unused subscriptions (Great, my newly bought apartment is not an asset yet but a liability) We must try to keep liabilities and expenses low.
  
### Difference between being an employee or be an owner 
- employees who work for somebody else spend their money post-tax, while business owners earn and spend **before** tax

### Inventing money 
- Identify opportunities that other people have not found
- Raise funds for investment 
- Work with other intelligent people

### Work to learn - don't work for money
- learn how to manage cash flow, systems, and people
- overcome the five obstacles
1. Fear (of losing money)
2. Cynicism (don't let "what ifs" immobilize you as opportunities pass by)
3. Laziness (be proactive and take care of yourself and your wealth first)
4. Bad haits
5. Arrogance

### Actions
- assess what is and isn't working today
- look for new ideas by finding resources on different and unique subjects
- be mindful about daily to-dos, and educate yourself
- leverage the power of association, find good friends who lift you up rather than bog you down with fear
-  have a role model or mentor to follow and tap into the power of their genius to put to your use
-  if you want something, you need to give something first.
-  look for changes that create bargains in your surroundings

### My review
The book motivates you to start develop your own unique path to financial independence, and be aware of getting stuck in the mindless rat race (working for someone else's company). It has tons of good concepts but lacks details and examples. Working as an employee is not necessarily a demeaning life choice but it's high time to start a side hustle and learn more about the legal loopholes of the tax system in your country.
