title: Takeaways from "The Five Elements of Effective Thinking"
---

## Understand deeply
clear the clutter and expose what's really important. Identify and fill the gaps without bias, prejudice and preconceived notions.
Rock solid understanding is the foundation for success

## Make mistakes
Intentionally get it wrong to get it even more right. Failure to succeed ignites your imagination.

## Raise questions
The right questions will bring ideas out and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible.

## Follow the flow of ideas
Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to see where those ideas may lead.

## Change
change the way you think and learn by mastering the first four elements. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning.

### What's more...
The book does offer some insights but none of them are particularly new or shocking. I have been trying to change my mindset and improve myself recently. Some of the takeaways from other books I skimmed through are:
- One of the most powerful things you can do is deeply understand your motivations, your strengths, and your weaknesses. Then you can find the best ways to keep yourself motivated so you actually see success and not get bogged down in your weaknesses.
-  There is no ‘get ___ quick’ in life. You have to put in the work, doing all the boring stuff over a long period of time, to really see success. All those tiny steps can add up over time to big positive changes.
- Stop chasing happiness and caring about things that don’t really matter. Instead, understand the things that are deeply important to you and align with your values. Then focus on those, let the rest fall away and stop expending your energy on them.
- It’s easy to get comfortable and not show the best parts of ourselves to the outside world because of fear. Instead, find the courage step out into things that force you to expose yourself and be vulnerable so people can meet the real you.
- You have to learn how to focus, and apply that focus to just one thing at a time, with the most important thing you have to do first. We’ve been conditioned to think that multi-tasking makes us more productive and thus more valuable, in fact, the opposite is true.
- Motion is when you’re busy doing something, but that task will never produce an outcome by itself. Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will get you a result.
