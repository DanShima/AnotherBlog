Have you ever been in an interview and wonder what questions you should ask? Do you find yourself quickly googling some standard questions before going to an interview? Or do you mostly care about what you do as a developer and end up joining a company that doesn't fit you because you didn't find out enough about them beforehand?

I had answered "yes" to all the questions above in the past. All I wanted to do is to sell myself as the right candidate so I can get into X company.

But, this is the wrong kind of mindset. According to [Sam Texas](https://www.simplecto.com), it's YOU who holds the talent and YOU are one of the developers who are sought after by companies. Companies do whatever they can to appear like the perfect work space, to please you, and not the other way around. So use this entitlement and ask good, bold questions without fearing to lose points in their eyes. In fact, candidates who ask in-depth and high-level questions beyond their responsibilities-to-be are considered sharp, participative and curious.

So, what questions can you ask?

### keep asking
- your co-workers, teams, work flow, way of collaboration and communication, tools, the type of work environment

### add to your checklist
- company culture/AW activities, estimated headcount in x months, market expansion, concerns/challenges, turnover rate, profit, funding, clients, competitors, vision and mission
- roadmap, potential features, architecture, user retention, UX vision.


There is no ONE definitive checklist, but ultimately, I encourage you to ask more company-related questions. Check out the news and company press about their latest activities. Get inside the head of those interviewers sitting in front of you and find out what bothers them. Take more time to talk to your potential colleagues. Be bold and honest. Show them you care, because you do.

Finding the right work place is tough and energy consuming. Sometimes you need to take a leap of faith, sometimes you need to trust your guts, but it never hurts to take your time and get a better picture before you make your decision.
